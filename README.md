# 🤖 Agentic AI Demand Intelligence & Mission Planning System

An **Agentic AI-powered decision support system** that automatically analyzes messy sales data, forecasts future demand, and assists businesses in planning **what to sell, where to sell, and how much to distribute**, with optional inventory awareness and logistics routing.

This project is designed to simulate **real-world retail & supply chain intelligence**, not just theoretical predictions.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 📂 Works with **any CSV format** (no fixed schema required)
- 🧠 Automatically understands data structure (dates, products, regions, demand)
- 🔮 Forecasts demand for **3–90 day horizons**
- 📊 Transparent visual dashboards (bars, heatmaps, trends)
- 🗺️ Hub-based mission route planning (no paid APIs)
- 👤 Human-centric AI insights (decision support, not commands)

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to:
- Understand **which products are in demand**
- Identify **where demand is emerging**
- Predict **future demand accurately**
- Plan logistics without expensive APIs

This system addresses all of the above using **local, open-source AI models** and **agent-based intelligence**.

## 🧠 System Architecture (Agentic Design)

The system is built using multiple cooperating AI agents:

1. **Schema Intelligence Agent**
   - Detects date, product, region, and demand columns from any CSV
   - Handles messy, real-world datasets

2. **Forecasting Agent**
   - Performs time-series forecasting (Holt-Winters)
   - Supports flexible horizons: 3, 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 days

3. **Demand Intelligence Engine**
   - Aggregates product & region demand
   - Builds ranked insights and heatmaps

4. **Decision Insight Agent**
   - Converts forecasts into **human-readable business insights**
   - Avoids commanding language (decision support only)

5. **Geo Navigation Agent**
   - Performs hub-based route optimization
   - Estimates distance, ETA, and fuel cost (offline)
